Welcome to theblacklion.net, my personal webpage on which I plan to share all kinds of things I am messing around with in my personal time.

Mostly this means computer related stuff and tips & tricks around issues I came across and managed to solve, in the hope this might help others too. I usually write my posts in English but you might find a post in my mother tongue German from time to time.
