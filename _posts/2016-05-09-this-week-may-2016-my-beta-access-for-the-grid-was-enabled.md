This week (May 2016) my beta access for [The Grid][0] was enabled. Actually this website as well as my let's play website atraleo.com is running on it.   
After playing around with it for a few hours it definitely feels like a beta - actually an early beta (although I am member 40.000-something to be on-boarded).

Under the hood it is awesome. The designs created by the AI and the possible achievable variety with just a few sliders and settings is impressive.   
The user interface is, where the beta status shows. It sometimes misses to save your input and the publishing button is not there when you need it. And even so it is kept very minimalist, the few settings you have are well distributed on different screens and therefore also not the easiest to work with. But it is not fundamentally broken and you can work your way around it.  
Functionality-wise, it can currently only handle to create simple blog websites. Putting single posts into the navigation bar is the limit of site structure it supports. Every unnecessary feature was stripped out (or probably never put in in the first place) and some arguably necessary ones as well.

I go into this adventure with The Grid being fully aware that I do not have control over the details the AI handles and how the team behind The Gird considers the features need to be to work with the general idea or which features work at all. I hope I will also provide valuable feedback to the beta process, but as an IT veteran I manage to figure out workarounds and find well hidden documentation rather easily and forget the need to have these issues fixed.   
As mentioned in the beginning, as of now I run two websites with The Grid but as simple as they are, they are at the limit of what is currently possible and my ideas to grow the sites already exceed the current possibilites of The Grid. But for now I keep them there with the hopes to see more functionality coming in the soon future.
